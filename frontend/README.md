### Installing

To get started, you'll first want to clone this repository to your local machine.

Do this by running `git clone` with the repository URL.

The project folder contains a `backend` and `frontend` directory.
These may be split into seperate repositories in the future.

Once cloned to your machine, you will need to install depencies for the project.

Do this by running `yarn install` or `npm install` in both directories.

Once dependices have been installed, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` .

Similarly for the backend, navigate to the `backend` directory and run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` .
